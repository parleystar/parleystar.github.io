<h3>UK USER RIGHTS</h3>
<h4>Right to cancel</h4>
<p>Unless exceptions apply, if you qualify as a consumer in the United Kingdom, you have the right to withdraw from a contract within a specified period (usually 14 days), without giving any reason. If you do not fit this qualification, you cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>
<h4>Exercising your right to cancel</h4>
<p>To withdraw from a contract, you must inform us clearly of your decision. This can be done using a cancellation form or by any other clear statement. Make sure to do this before the cancellation period ends.</p>
<h4>Cancellation period</h4>
<ul>
 <li>for goods, the cancellation period ends 14 days after you or a designated third party takes physical possession of the goods;</li>
 <li>for multiple goods ordered together or delivered separately, the cancellation period ends 14 days after you or a designated third party acquires physical possession of the last good.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Effects of cancellation</h4>
<p>If you correctly withdraw from a contract, we will reimburse you for all payments made to us, including any delivery costs, if applicable.</p>
<p>However, any additional costs resulting from choosing a delivery method other than our standard option will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>We will process your reimbursement promptly and no later than 14 days after we receive your cancellation notification. Reimbursements will be made using the same payment method you used for the initial transaction unless agreed otherwise. You will not incur any costs or fees for this reimbursement.</p>
<h4>... on the purchase of physical goods</h4>
<p>Unless we have offered to collect the goods, you must return them to us or to a person authorized by us without delay and no later than 14 days after notifying us of your decision to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>Your deadline is met if you hand the goods to the carrier or return them as instructed before the 14-day period expires. We may withhold reimbursement until we receive the goods or until you provide evidence of returning them, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>You are responsible for any diminished value of the goods resulting from handling beyond what is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics, and functioning.</p>
<p>You will bear the costs of returning the goods.</p>
<h2>GUARANTEES</h2>
<h3>Legal guarantee of conformity for goods under EU law</h3>
<p>We guarantee the conformity of goods sold to European consumers for at least 2 years from delivery. This guarantee applies to goods on our website according to the laws of your country.</p>
<p>The laws of your country may grant you broader rights regarding legal guarantees of conformity.</p>
<h3>Conformity to contract for consumers in the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>UK consumers have the right to receive goods that conform to the contract.</p>
<h2>LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
<p>We limit our liability as much as legally allowed when executing agreements with you. This means our responsibility for damages is reduced to the maximum extent permitted by law unless explicitly stated otherwise or agreed upon with you.</p>
<h4>Indemnification</h4>
<p>You agree to indemnify us and our affiliates, officers, directors, and employees from any claims or demands made by third parties due to or in connection with any culpable violation of these terms or third-party rights related to your use of the service to the extent allowed by law.</p>
<h4>Limitation of liability</h4>
<p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise and subject to applicable law, you cannot claim damages against us (or any individual or entity acting on our behalf).</p>
<p>However, this exclusion does not apply to damages affecting life, health, or physical integrity, damages arising from the breach of significant contractual obligations (such as those necessary to fulfill the contract's purpose), and/or damages resulting from intentional or gross negligence, provided that our website has been used appropriately and correctly by you.</p>
<p>Unless damages stem from intentional or gross negligence, or they impact life, health, or physical integrity, our liability is limited to typical and foreseeable damages at the time the contract was entered into.</p>
<h3>US users</h3>
<h4>Disclaimer of warranties</h4>
<p>Our website is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. When you use our service, you are doing so at your own risk. We explicitly state that we are not making any promises or guarantees, whether they are express, implied, or even required by law. These include assurances about the quality of the service, its suitability for your specific needs, or whether it infringes on anyone else's rights. Please keep in mind that any advice or information you receive from us or through our service does not create any warranties beyond what we have explicitly stated here.</p>
<p>Additionally, while we strive to provide accurate and reliable content, we cannot guarantee that it is always going to be the case. We do not guarantee that the service will always meet your requirements or be available when you need it. There might be interruptions, or it might not function correctly due to factors beyond our control. While we do our best to keep everything running smoothly, we cannot ensure that the service will be free of harmful elements like viruses. If you choose to download any content from our service, you are assuming the risk, and we are not responsible for any damage it might cause to your devices or data.</p>
<p>We do not endorse or guarantee any products or services advertised through our service or any links we provide. We are not involved in any transactions between you and third-party providers, so any interactions or agreements you make with them are solely your responsibility.</p>
<p>Our service might not always be accessible or may not work correctly with your web browser, mobile device, or operating system. While we strive to provide a seamless experience, we cannot guarantee it in every situation. As such, we want to clarify that we cannot be held responsible for any perceived or actual damages that result from issues related to the content, operation, or use of our service.</p>
<p>While we may have certain exclusions and limitations in our agreement, these may not apply to you depending on the laws of your jurisdiction. Federal law, as well as laws in some states and other jurisdictions, may offer protections that supersede our disclaimers and exclusions. This means that you may have specific legal rights that are not affected by our agreement. It is essential to understand your rights, as they may vary from state to state or country to country. We want to emphasize that any disclaimers or exclusions in our agreement will only be enforced to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h4>Limitation of liability</h4>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall we, along with our subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, partners, suppliers, or employees, be liable for:</p>
<ul>
 <li>any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising from or related to your use of, or inability to use, the service. This includes damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses;</li>
 <li>any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or unauthorized access to your account or the information within it;</li>
 <li>errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies in the content provided;</li>
 <li>personal injury or property damage resulting from your use of the service;</li>
 <li>unauthorized access to our secure servers or personal information stored therein;</li>
 <li>interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the service;</li>
 <li>bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or similar harmful elements transmitted through the service;</li>
 <li>errors or omissions in any content posted, transmitted, or made available through the service;</li>
 <li>defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any user or third party. Our liability is limited to the amount you have paid us in the preceding 12 months, or the duration of your agreement with us, whichever is shorter.</li>
</ul>
<p>This limitation of liability section will apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if you have been advised of the possibility of such damage.</p>
<p>Please note that in some jurisdictions, the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages may not be allowed. This means that these limitations or exclusions might not apply to you. You have specific legal rights, which may vary depending on your jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability outlined here may not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<h4>Indemnification</h4>
<p>By using and accessing the service, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers, and employees harmless from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses, including legal fees, arising from:</p>

<h2>COMMON PROVISIONS</h2>

<p>To maintain the best service level, we reserve the right to interrupt the service for maintenance, updates, or other changes, with appropriate notification.</p>
<p>We may suspend or discontinue the service within legal limits. If discontinued, we will assist you in withdrawing personal data and respect your rights regarding continued product use and compensation under applicable law.</p>
<p>The service may be unavailable due to events beyond our reasonable control, such as infrastructure breakdowns or blackouts.</p>

<h3>Intellectual property rights</h3>
<p>Without prejudice to any more specific provisions in these terms, all intellectual property rights associated with our website, including copyrights, trademark rights, patent rights, and design rights, are exclusively owned by us or our licensors. These rights are protected by applicable laws and international treaties concerning intellectual property.</p>
<p>All trademarks, whether nominal or figurative, and any other marks, trade names, service marks, word marks, illustrations, images, or logos associated with our website, are and remain the exclusive property of us or our licensors. These are also protected by applicable laws and international treaties related to intellectual property.</p>
<h3>Changes to the terms</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time, informing you of any changes.</p>
<p>Such changes will only affect the relationship with you from the date communicated onwards.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the service will signify your acceptance of the revised terms. If you do not wish to be bound by the changes, you must stop using the service and terminate the agreement.</p>
<p>The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to your acceptance. You can obtain any previous version from us.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>All communications regarding the use of our website must be sent using the contact information provided in this document.</p>
<h3>Severability</h3>
<p>Invalidity or unenforceability of any provision under applicable law will not affect the validity of other provisions, which will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h4>US users</h4>
<p>Any invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable, and consistent with its original intent. This document constitutes the entire agreement between you and us and supersedes all other communications, including but not limited to prior agreements concerning such subject matter, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h4>EU users</h4>
<p>If any provision of this document is void, invalid, or unenforceable, we both agree to do our best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions. <br>
In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid, or unenforceable provisions will be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions.</p>
<p>Regardless of the above, the nullity, invalidity, or impossibility of enforcing a particular provision of this document will not nullify the entire agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential for it, or of such importance that we both would not have entered into the contract if we had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship for you or us.</p>
<h3>Governing law</h3>
<p>These terms are governed by the law of the place where we are based, as outlined in the relevant section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.</p>
<h4>Prevalence of national law</h4>
<p>However, regardless of the above, if the law of the country that you are based on provides for higher applicable consumer protection standards, such higher standards will prevail.</p>
<h3>Venue of jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The jurisdiction over any controversy related to these terms lies with the courts of the place where we are based, as outlined in the relevant section of this document.</p>
<h4>Exception for consumers in Europe</h4>
<p>However, regardless of the above, this does not apply if you qualify as a European consumer or if you are a consumer based in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, or Iceland.</p>
<h4>UK consumers</h4>
<p>If you are a consumer based in England and Wales, you may bring legal proceedings related to these terms in the English and Welsh courts. If you are a consumer based in Scotland, you may bring legal proceedings in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you are a consumer based in Northern Ireland, you may bring legal proceedings in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.</p>
<h4>US users</h4>
<p>We both agree to waive any right to trial by jury in any court in connection with any action or litigation. <br>
Any claims under these terms shall proceed individually and we both agree not to join in a class action or other proceeding with or on behalf of others.</p>
<h3>US users</h3>
